---

## 🎯 Quick Start

### For Developers

**Create your first command in 3 steps:**

1. **Read the basics**
   ```bash
   cat 02-Individual-Command-Creation.md
   ```

2. **Use a template**
   ```bash
   cp templates/commands/start-session.md .claude/commands/
   ```

3. **Run your command**
   ```
   /start-session
   ```

### For AI Coding Assistants

**When generating commands or agents:**

1. Load core context:
   ```
   @01-Introduction-and-Core-Principles.md
   @CLAUDE.md
   ```

2. Review specific guidance:
   - Commands → `@02-Individual-Command-Creation.md`
   - Agents → `@03-Individual-Agent-Configuration.md`
   - Orchestration → `@04-Multi-Agent-Orchestration.md`

3. Follow the documented patterns and use provided templates

### For Multi-Agent Orchestration (NEW)

**Launch parallel development in 4 steps:**

1. **Describe your feature**
   ```
   I need to implement user authentication with multiple approaches
   (OAuth, JWT, and session-based) to compare and select the best
   ```

2. **Orchestrate the feature**
   ```
   /orchestrate-feature
   ```
   Creates MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md with tasks, dependencies, and agent assignments

3. **Spawn agents in parallel**
   ```
   /spawn-agents
   ```
   Instantiates specialized agents in isolated git worktrees

4. **Monitor and integrate**
   ```
   /coordinate-workflow  # Real-time progress tracking
   /quality-gate         # Multi-stage validation
   ```

**Result**: 3 parallel implementations completed in 2-3 hours vs. 8 hours sequential

**Example workflow**:
```bash
# Agent 1 (Architect): Designs API specification → 30 min
# Agent 2 (Builder):   Implements OAuth 2.0     → 90 min
# Agent 3 (Builder):   Implements JWT           → 75 min
# Agent 4 (Validator): Security testing         → 45 min (waits for 2&3)

# Total wall-clock time: ~2.5 hours (vs 4+ hours sequential)
# Productivity gain: 3.2x faster + quality through comparison
```

## 🎨 Template Library

### Agent Templates

Professional agent configurations for specialized roles.

**Note**: With Anthropic's skills-first approach, these templates now serve two purposes:

1. **As Skill Packages** (Recommended): Convert to skills for use with a general agent
   - More efficient and maintainable
   - Can be composed with other skills
   - See Phase 4 conversions in progress

2. **As Multi-Agent Configs** (For Parallel Work): Use when spawning workers for concurrent tasks
   - Each worker loads appropriate skills
   - Use orchestrator-worker pattern
   - See [Multi-Agent Orchestration guide](docs/best-practices/04-Multi-Agent-Orchestration.md)

**Migration Path**: Most users should start by using these as skills with a general agent, and only introduce multi-agent orchestration when parallel execution is necessary.

## 🧠 Agent Skills vs. Multi-Agent Architecture

**NEW**: Anthropic's latest research shows that for most workflows, a **general agent with dynamically-loaded skills** outperforms multiple specialized agents in terms of cost, maintainability, and efficiency.

### The Shift

**OLD**: Build separate agents for each role (OAuth-agent, JWT-agent, Session-agent)
**NEW**: One general agent + specialized skills (OAuth-skill, JWT-skill, Session-skill)

### When to Use What

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Sequential coding workflows | ✅ Single agent + skills |
| Parallel research tasks | ✅ Multi-agent |
| Complex features (hybrid) | ✅ Both (orchestrator + workers with skills) |
| Feature implementation | ✅ Single agent + skills |
| Bug fixes and refactoring | ✅ Single agent + skills |
| Exploring multiple approaches | ✅ Multi-agent (parallel builders) |
| Multi-environment deployment | ✅ Multi-agent (per environment) |

### Benefits of Skills Approach

- **35% reduction** in token usage through context reuse
- **Single agent** to maintain and configure
- **Composable capabilities** - combine skills for complex workflows
- **Progressive context loading** - load only what's needed per phase
- **Easier knowledge sharing** across teams and projects
- **Faster onboarding** - understand one agent pattern + modular skills

### When Multi-Agent Still Makes Sense

- **Breadth-first parallel tasks** - Research across independent sources
- **Multiple independent workstreams** - Concurrent feature development
- **Exploring alternative approaches** simultaneously
- **Time-sensitive deliverables** requiring parallel execution
- **Large-scale operations** needing true concurrency

### Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)

For complex features, combine both patterns:
```
Orchestrator (Opus 4)
  ↓
Spawns workers (Sonnet 4)
  ↓
Each worker loads appropriate skills dynamically
```

**Result**: Parallel execution efficiency + skills-first token optimization

## 🔄 Integration & Maintenance System

**NEW**: Automated content ingestion and repository health monitoring.

### What is the Integration System?

The Integration System provides automated workflows for:
- **Ingesting new content** - Commands, agents, skills, and documentation
- **Validating quality** - Structure, security, and standards compliance
- **Integrating seamlessly** - Moving files to correct locations and updating docs
- **Maintaining audit trails** - Complete logs of all integration activities

### How It Works

**Step 1: Add Content**
Place new files in `/INTEGRATION/incoming/`:
```bash
cp my-new-command.md /INTEGRATION/incoming/
```

**Step 2: Scan**
```
/integration-scan
```
Categorizes files and generates detailed report.

**Step 3: Review**
Check the scan report at `/INTEGRATION/logs/scan-report-[timestamp].md`

**Step 4: Integrate** *(Coming Soon)*
```
/integration-process    # Move validated files to proper locations
/integration-validate   # Run comprehensive quality checks
/integration-update-docs  # Update all documentation
```

### What is the Maintenance System?

The Maintenance System keeps the repository healthy by:
- **Identifying stale content** - Files not updated in 30+ days
- **Researching improvements** - Latest best practices and patterns
- **Proposing updates** - Concrete action items for evolution
- **Tracking repository health** - Freshness scores and metrics

### How It Works

**Step 1: Scan for Stale Files**
```
/maintenance-scan
```
Generates report at `/MAINTENANCE/todo/stale-files-[timestamp].md`

**Step 2: Review Priority Files** *(Coming Soon)*
```
/maintenance-review path/to/stale-file.md
```
Research Specialist agent investigates and proposes updates.

**Step 3: Update Development Plan** *(Coming Soon)*
```
/maintenance-plan-update
```
Adds approved improvements to `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`

### Directory Structure

```
/INTEGRATION/
├── incoming/     # Drop new files here
├── processed/    # Archive of successfully integrated files
├── failed/       # Files that didn't pass validation
└── logs/         # Scan and integration reports

/MAINTENANCE/
├── reports/      # Research findings and proposals
└── todo/         # Stale file lists and action items
```

### Integration Manager Agent

The **Integration Manager** orchestrates the entire ingestion pipeline:
- Scans incoming directories
- Categorizes by type (Command/Agent/Skill/Doc)
- Validates against repository standards
- Coordinates file movement and documentation updates
- Maintains comprehensive audit trails

See: [agents-templates/integration-manager.md](agents-templates/integration-manager.md)

### Benefits

✅ **Consistency** - All content follows repository standards

✅ **Security** - Automated validation catches security issues

✅ **Quality** - Comprehensive checks before integration

✅ **Automation** - Reduces manual file management

✅ **Audit Trail** - Complete history of all changes

✅ **Repository Health** - Proactive staleness detection

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns

### Single Agent + Skills Pattern (Recommended Default)

For most workflows, use a general agent that dynamically loads skills:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   General Agent (Claude)                    │
│                                                             │
│  Dynamically Loads Skills Based on Task:                   │
│  ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐    │
│  │ Builder  │ │Validator│ │  Scribe  │ │  DevOps  │    │
│  │  Skill   │ │  Skill   │ │  Skill   │ │  Skill   │    │
│  └──────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits**:
- Maintains context across workflow phases
- **35% more token-efficient** than multi-agent
- Single agent to configure and maintain
- Skills are composable and reusable
- Progressive context loading
- Easier knowledge sharing

**Use For**:
- Feature implementation (sequential workflows)
- Bug fixes and refactoring
- Documentation generation
- Code reviews and testing
- Standard development tasks

---

### The Orchestrator-Worker Pattern (For Parallel Tasks)

**Best for breadth-first parallelizable work:**
- Research across multiple independent sources
- Exploring multiple solution approaches simultaneously
- Multi-environment deployments
- Large-scale concurrent operations

**NOT recommended for:**
- Sequential coding workflows
- Single-threaded task execution
- When context needs to flow between steps

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Lead Agent (Orchestrator)               │
│         - Claude Opus 4                         │
│         - Request analysis                      │
│         - Task decomposition                    │
│         - Result synthesis                      │
└────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
             │
             │ Spawns & coordinates
             │
    ┌────────┴────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
    │                 │          │          │
┌───▼───┐       ┌─────▼────┐  ┌──▼────┐   ┌─▼─────┐
│Builder│       │Validator │  │Scribe │   │DevOps │
│Sonnet │       │Sonnet    │  │Sonnet │   │Sonnet │
└───────┘       └──────────┘  └───────┘   └───────┘
```

**Key Benefits**:
- Parallel execution of independent tasks
- Cost optimization (efficient models for routine work)
- Specialized expertise per domain
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Maintainable complexity

**When to Use**:
- Feature development spanning multiple concerns
- Complex refactoring requiring testing and documentation
- Release preparation with quality gates
- Multi-environment deployment orchestration

**Modern Hybrid Approach**: Orchestrator spawns workers that each load appropriate skills:

```
┌───────────────────────────┐
│   Orchestrator Agent      │
│   (Opus 4)                │
└───────────┬───────────────┘
            │
   ┌────────┼────────┐
   │        │        │
┌──▼─────┐ ┌▼──────┐ ┌▼──────┐
│Agent 1 │ │Agent 2│ │Agent 3│
│+Skills │ │+Skills│ │+Skills│
└────────┘ └───────┘ └───────┘
```

**Result**: Parallel execution + skills-first token efficiency

---

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns

**NEW**: Advanced patterns for parallel, concurrent multi-agent development with git worktree isolation.

#### The Hybrid AI Agent Development Pattern

Combine git worktrees with multi-agent orchestration for massive productivity gains:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            Lead Orchestrator (Claude Opus 4)             │
│  • Decomposes feature into parallel tasks                │
│  • Spawns specialized agents in isolated worktrees       │
│  • Monitors progress and coordinates handoffs            │
│  • Synthesizes results and resolves conflicts            │
└───────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                        │
        ┌───────────────┼────────────────┬────────────────┐
        │               │                │                │
        ▼               ▼                ▼                ▼
┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
│  Agent 1    │  │  Agent 2    │  │  Agent 3   │  │  Agent 4    │
│  Architect  │  │  Builder    │  │  Builder   │  │  Validator  │
│             │  │  (OAuth)    │  │  (JWT)     │  │             │
│ Worktree:   │  │ Worktree:   │  │ Worktree:  │  │ Worktree:   │
│ ../arch     │  │ ../impl-v1  │  │ ../impl-v2 │  │ ../tests    │
│ Branch:     │  │ Branch:     │  │ Branch:    │  │ Branch:     │
│ feat/design │  │ feat/oauth  │  │ feat/jwt   │  │ feat/tests  │
└─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └────────────┘  └─────────────┘
```

**Key Benefits**:
- **3-10x faster**: Parallel execution vs. sequential development
- **Filesystem isolation**: No merge conflicts during development
- **Multiple approaches**: Explore variants, select best implementation
- **Stochastic diversity**: Non-deterministic LLM outputs as a feature
- **Clean integration**: Git worktrees share history, separate working dirs

**Workflow**:
1. **`/orchestrate-feature`** - Decompose feature, create MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md
2. **`/spawn-agents`** - Instantiate agents in isolated worktrees
3. **`/coordinate-workflow`** - Monitor progress, resolve blockers
4. **`/quality-gate`** - Multi-stage validation before merge
5. **`/worktree-setup`** - Manage workspace lifecycle and cleanup

**Example**: Implementing authentication with 3 parallel approaches (OAuth, JWT, Session-based):
- **Sequential**: 8 hours (1 approach, tested, documented)
- **Parallel (3 agents)**: 2.5 hours (explore all 3, select best, integrate)
- **Speedup**: 3.2x faster + higher quality through comparison

|-------|---------|-------------|
| **[multi-agent-planner-skill](skills-templates/orchestration/multi-agent-planner-skill.md)** | Automated MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md generation with dependency analysis | Orchestrate-feature command |
| **[parallel-executor-skill](skills-templates/orchestration/parallel-executor-skill.md)** | Concurrent task execution with work distribution and result aggregation | Spawn-agents, coordinate-workflow |
| **[worktree-manager-skill](skills-templates/orchestration/worktree-manager-skill.md)** | Git worktree lifecycle management and merge strategies | Worktree-setup command |
| **[agent-communication-skill](skills-templates/orchestration/agent-communication-skill.md)** | Inter-agent messaging and handoff documentation | Coordinate-workflow command |

#### Decision Matrix: When to Use Multi-Agent Orchestration

| Scenario | Use Orchestration? | Recommended Pattern |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Simple bug fix (< 100 lines) | ❌ No | Single Builder agent |
| Feature with clear implementation (< 500 lines) | ❌ No | Single Builder + Validator |
| Complex feature with multiple approaches | ✅ Yes | Parallel builders + comparison |
| Large refactoring (multi-module) | ✅ Yes | Architect + parallel builders |
| Full-stack feature (FE + BE + DB + Tests + Docs) | ✅ Yes | Specialized agents per layer |
| Exploring technical solutions (POC) | ✅ Yes | Parallel researchers |

#### Git Worktree Integration Strategy

**Lightweight Isolation** (default for trusted code):
- **Setup time**: < 1 second per worktree
- **Disk overhead**: Minimal (shared .git)
- **Isolation level**: Filesystem only
- **Use case**: Parallel feature variants, rapid prototyping

**Container-Based Isolation** (security-critical):
- **Setup time**: 1-3 minutes per container
- **Disk overhead**: High (per-container layers)
- **Isolation level**: Full process isolation
- **Use case**: Untrusted code, compliance requirements

**Hybrid Approach** (production systems):
- Containers for primary isolation
- Worktrees within containers for lightweight filesystem separation
- Defense-in-depth security
- Resource quotas enforced at container level

## 🔒 Security & Safety

### Core Security Principles

1. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions per agent/command
2. **Explicit Allowlists**: Use `allowed-tools` to restrict operations
3. **Input Validation**: Sanitize all dynamic values and user inputs
4. **Approval Gates**: Require human confirmation for critical operations
5. **Audit Logging**: Maintain detailed logs of all agent actions
6. **Rollback Capability**: Design for safe recovery from failures

### Permission Model

```yaml
# Restrictive (default for most commands)
allowed-tools: ["Read", "Search"]

# Development (standard builder agent)
allowed-tools: ["Read", "Search", "Edit", "Test", "Bash(git:*)"]

# Operations (devops with infrastructure access)
allowed-tools: ["Read", "Edit", "Bash(git:*)", "Bash(docker:*)", "Bash(kubectl:*)"]

# NEVER grant unrestricted access
# ❌ allowed-tools: ["Bash(*)"]  # Dangerous!
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### Command Creation

✅ **Do**:
- Use descriptive verb-noun naming (`/prepare-pr`, `/deploy-check`)
- Specify explicit `allowed-tools` restrictions
- Include comprehensive inline documentation
- Implement error handling and validation
- Version semantic changes (1.0 → 1.1)

❌ **Don't**:
- Hardcode project-specific values
- Grant excessive permissions
- Create monolithic multi-purpose commands
- Skip input validation
- Forget to document expected behavior

### Agent Configuration

✅ **Do**:
- Define clear, focused roles
- Document responsibilities explicitly
- Implement context isolation
- Create handoff protocols
- Test agent interactions

❌ **Don't**:
- Create generalist "do everything" agents
- Allow unscoped context pollution
- Skip security boundary definitions
- Forget collaboration patterns
- Neglect memory management

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

✅ **Do**:
- Use orchestrator-worker pattern
- Create MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md for coordination
- Define clear communication protocols
- Implement parallel execution where possible
- Handle errors gracefully with recovery

❌ **Don't**:
- Create circular dependencies
- Skip dependency mapping
- Neglect error propagation
- Forget result validation
- Ignore cost optimization
